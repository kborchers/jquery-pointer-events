# jQuery Pointer Events

[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/kborchers.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/kborchers)

This is a polyfill for [Pointer Events](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/raw-file/tip/pointerEvents.html), written using jQuery's special events API.

Pointer Events provide a unified event model, which we feel provides a much
better future than Mouse + Touch. The jQuery team is very interested in seeing
a future where Mouse Events and Touch Events are a thing of the past, and all
developers leverage Pointer Events exclusively. This polyfill is an attempt to
make that dream a reality today.
